\section*{Executive Summary}

This document describes the completion of a recent  milestone of the ExaSMR program concerning  "Full core simulations". The ExaSMR project is developing tools for coupling \acf{mc} radiation
transport solvers to a \acf{cfd} solver.  Work is based on the Shift MC, OpenMC MC, and Nek5000/NekRS CFD codes.

As part of this milestone, a novel set of pin-resolved CFD full-core simulations have been performed for the first time. These simulations represent a significant increase in capability in what is now possible with CFD on pre-Exascale systems. The simulations have been performed with the spectral element solvers NekRS on the supercomputer Summit. Multiple simulations campaigns have been conducted: (1) LES simulations in bare bundle, (2) RANS simulations in bare bundles, (3) RANS simulations with momentum sources and (4) Conjugate heat transfer calculations.
